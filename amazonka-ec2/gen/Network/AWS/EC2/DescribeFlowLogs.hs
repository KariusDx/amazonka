-- | Creates a value of 'DescribeFlowLogs' with the minimum fields required to make a request.
--
-- Use one of the following lenses to modify other fields as desired:
--
-- * 'dflsNextToken' - The token to retrieve the next page of results.
--
-- * 'dflsFlowLogIds' - One or more flow log IDs.
--
-- * 'dflsFilter' - One or more filters.     * @deliver-log-status@ - The status of the logs delivery (@SUCCESS@ | @FAILED@ ).     * @log-destination-type@ - The type of destination to which the flow log publishes data. Possible destination types include @cloud-watch-logs@ and @S3@ .     * @flow-log-id@ - The ID of the flow log.     * @log-group-name@ - The name of the log group.     * @resource-id@ - The ID of the VPC, subnet, or network interface.     * @traffic-type@ - The type of traffic (@ACCEPT@ | @REJECT@ | @ALL@ ).
--
-- * 'dflsDryRun' - Checks whether you have the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response. If you have the required permissions, the error response is @DryRunOperation@ . Otherwise, it is @UnauthorizedOperation@ .
--
-- * 'dflsMaxResults' - The maximum number of results to return for the request in a single page. The remaining results can be seen by sending another request with the returned @NextToken@ value. This value can be between 5 and 1000. If @MaxResults@ is given a value larger than 1000, only 1000 results are returned. You cannot specify this parameter and the flow log IDs parameter in the same request.
